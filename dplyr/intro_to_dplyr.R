flights

# you can specify that you want to see more rows
print(flights, n=20)


# convert to a normal data frame to see all of the columns
data.frame(head(flights))


# filter: Keep rows matching criteria
# 
# Base R approach to filtering forces you to repeat the data frameâ€™s name dplyr
# approach is simpler to write and read Command structure (for all dplyr verbs):
# first argument is a data frame return value is a data frame nothing is
# modified in place Note: dplyr generally does not preserve row names

# base R approach to view all flights on January 1
flights[flights$Month==1 & flights$DayofMonth==1, ]

# use pipe for OR condition
filter(flights, UniqueCarrier=="AA" | UniqueCarrier=="UA")


# select: Pick columns by name
# 
# Base R approach is awkward to type and to read dplyr approach uses similar
# syntax to filter Like a SELECT in SQL

# base R approach to select DepTime, ArrTime, and FlightNum columns
flights[, c("DepTime", "ArrTime", "FlightNum")]

# dplyr approach
select(flights, DepTime, ArrTime, FlightNum)
